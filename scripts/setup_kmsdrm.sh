# KMS/DRM Pygame Setup Script for Raspberry Pi 5 (Lite OS)
#
# This script automates the installation of system dependencies,
# custom compilation of SDL2 with kmsdrm support, and source compilation
# of Pygame to ensure it correctly initializes on DSI screens without X/Wayland.
#
# IMPORTANT: This script assumes it is executed from the root directory
# of the 'pyvisualiser' project repository.
