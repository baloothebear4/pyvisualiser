# pyvisualiser
A generic music visualisation package intended for use on MacOS, Windows and linux based embedded music players &amp; preamplifiers (eg Raspberry Pi and Volumio/Moode etc). Rich api for eye-catching &amp; customisable music displays inc Spectrum Analysers, VU meters, Visualisations and Metadata (eg from  Roon  or MPD).

The package is in the alpha test stage with a Roon API for use on MacOS desktop.  The first port will be to a Rasberry Pi headless display.

Collaboration welcome!

I want to give credit to https://github.com/project-owner/PeppyMeter  for use of some of the VU images.  These have been incorporated as VU meter images
